# Hi, I’m Sindhu 👋

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate at **Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology (CBIT)** with a strong interest in **backend systems, APIs, and production software engineering**.

I enjoy building reliable systems, understanding how things work under the hood, and writing clean, maintainable code. I’ve worked on real-world projects involving authentication, REST APIs, real-time systems, and Agile collaboration.
